# Useful Components
This repo is a dumping ground for any components that end up being scrapped from my personal projects but I still find generally useful.

These components are shown using Storybook, so you can interact with them locally, see how they react to different inputs, and modify them.

## Components
- Flexible File Path

## Running locally
After cloning this repo on your machine,
1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run storybook` to interact with the different components
